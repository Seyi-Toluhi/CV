# About me
A dedicated software developer, always striving to innovate and excel in crafting efficient solutions. With over 5 years of experience as a Legal officer and HO compliance caseworker, I will leverage my natural attention to detail, creativity and experience with clients to coding and consultation with clients. Throughout my experience, I have thoroughly enjoyed working with others and supporting those around me, along with the challenge of solving problems with clientele and software.

My journey through a rigorous software engineering boot camp at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/) has given me a strong foundation, which I continually enhance through self-learning and personal projects. I am excited to collaborate with dynamic agile teams and aim to apply my skills to tackle challenges and adapt to the ever-evolving world of software development.

I’m currently working on [Lingo Voyage](https://github.com/Seyi-Toluhi/language_learning_app) - a full-stack application that teaches Spanish and Yoruba(my native language). I designed all aspects of Lingo Voyage from it's UI to it's backend and database structure.
